Introduction
------------

This repository is work-in-progress for proving that the smash product is a 1-coherent monoidal
product on pointed types (pages 88 and 89 of my thesis).  The main idea of this approach is that the
proof will be generated by a program (also written in Agda).  At the time of writing, it can
generate everything except for
- the pentagon
- compatibility of smashing of maps with composition
- everything related to the unit

Structure
---------

Here is a description of all the files in this repository.

- `SmashGenerated.agda` : The program generating the proof, it is compiled and executed as follows:

```
agda-2.5.4.1 --compile SmashGenerate.agda
./SmashGenerate > dump.agda
```

- `Sprintf.agda` : Contains a rudimentary printf-like function, often used in `SmashGenerated.agda`.

- `SmashCommon.agda` and `SmashDefs.agda` : Contain many helper functions that are used in the
  generated proof.

- `SmashDefsGlobular.agda` : Not used at the moment

- `GeneratedCodePart1.agda` : Contains the smash product for maps, its compatibility with identity
  functions, symmetry for the smash product, its involutivity, associativity and its inverse,
  naturality for symmetry and associativity.

- `GeneratedCodePart2.agda` : Contains the proof that the associativity map and its inverse and
  indeed inverse to each other.

- `GeneratedCodePart3.agda` : Contains the proof of the hexagon.
